About the game

You play as Melchiades, a young alchemist who wants to learn the secrets of eternal life. His mentor, Adam invited him to join the Rosicrucian Order, an ancient secret organization of alchemists, who offer their knowledge to those who are worthy.

After succeeding in his initial trials, Melchiades only needs to pass the ultimate test: obtain the philosopherâ€™s stone.

Usually, such a feat would be beyond the capabilities of a single individual, but through the ages of collected techniques, Kadmon offers their initiates the recipe to test them; however, there is a catch.
